---
---


# Schedule

This workshop is divided into 5 main sections:

1. **Introduction**: This section sets the theme of the workshop and also reviews ClimSim, a paper and dataset accepted in the Neurips 2023 Datasets and Benchmarks Track used for the competition.

2. **Spotlight ClimSim submissions**: This section covers spotlight talks and a poster session for exceptional submissions to the upcoming ClimSim competition.

3. **Advancing the Domain**: This section covers cases of how machine learning is changing the underlying domain science of earth system modeling.

4. **New Directions**: This section discusses ways in which advancements in physics-guided machine learning can manifest in future breakthroughs for earth system modeling.

5. **Panel Discussion**: The panel discussion seeks to bring everything together for a thoughtful discussion on how machine learning will continue to advance the future of earth system modeling given existing opportunities for low-hanging fruit and promising new directions.

The coffee breaks, poster sessions, Q&A sessions, and panel discussion will serve as opportunities for broad discussion. Invited speakers will be expected to give 20-minute talks with 5 minutes left for Q&A, where questions are taken from invited speakers. For the panel discussion, questions will be taken from online and in-person attendees.
