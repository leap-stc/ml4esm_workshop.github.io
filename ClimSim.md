# ClimSim Kaggle Competition

The response of clouds to future warming is a leading source of uncertainty in long-term climate projections. 
A fundamental blocker is the sheer computational complexity associated with explicitly resolving certain subgrid processes,
like clouds and storms. Because of this computational complexity, operational climate models used for experiments and projections
rely on "parameterizations" designed to crudely approximate the effects of such processes. As a consequence, key uncertainties remain
with respect to changes to precipitation as well as the frequency and magnitude of extreme events.

The climate science community needs YOUR help to design Machine Learning (ML) models that can emulate subgrid effects of 
atmospheric storms, clouds, turbulence, rainfall, and radiation inside E3SM-MMF, a multi-scale climate model actively 
supported by the Department of Energy (DoE). With better models, we can bring greater clarity to the hazards associated 
with our warming future and empower policymakers with the knowledge necessary to mitigate them.
