# Submission requirements

We welcome papers for up to **4 pages** in length, excluding reference and supplementary materials. See information on [Author Instructions](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorInstructions), [LaTeX style files](https://media.icml.cc/Conferences/ICML2024/Styles/icml2024.zip) and an [Example Paper](https://media.icml.cc/Conferences/ICML2023/Styles/example_paper.pdf). Submissions must clearly articulate applications relevant to earth system modelling. Accepted papers will be invited to give poster presentations, and a total of six will be invited to give spotlight talks.

Previously published work should not be submitted to this workshop. To be more precise, we will adhere to ICML's policy here: “It is not appropriate to submit papers that are identical (or substantially similar) to versions that have been previously published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals.”

# Review Process

The review process for this workshop is double-blind, and we are accumulating a pool of reviewers with relevant expertise.
